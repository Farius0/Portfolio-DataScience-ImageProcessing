# Portfolio -- Data Science & Image Processing

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio.

I explore data from multiple angles, at the intersection of analytics, applied machine learning, and image processing.

What drives me is turning complex data into structured, usable insights, whether in public-sector analytics, industrial innovation, or applied research contexts.

This portfolio brings together academic, professional, and personal projects that reflect how I approach data: understanding it deeply, experimenting thoughtfully, and building solutions that are robust, documented, and reusable.

Rather than focusing on a single role or title, this space reflects my curiosity, my technical craftsmanship, and my ongoing journey through data-driven problem solving.
